Whether the patient accepts such remedies or not, without treatment, Blood Rot is deadly, and will likely end in a visit from the Mourners' Guild and [[the Cult of Morr]].\n\n*Source: WFRP Core Rulebook*",

Poultices fashioned from wrapped leaves and dung, the skin of toads, and dove-feathers are common, as is rubbing the wound in Sigmar's Good Soil. Most physicians rubbish such talk, and prefer more scientific curatives, such as mixing the gall of a black ox with three spoonfuls of the patient's urine and half a spoon of sea salt, which is then rubbed into the festering, pus-filled wound. The screams this elicits prove just how effective the remedy is.\n\n*Source: WFRP Core Rulebook*",

Though rarely fatal, it's a debilitating disease, and it takes a long time to recover, so most are willing to try anything to lessen the symptoms. Common remedies include self-flagellation in Altdorf — which reputedly does bring some relief to the skin infections — and smearing oneself in goat-cheese mixed with imported Kislevite ice-peppers in Talabheim. In the bigger towns and cities, Ratte Fever is also known as Pie Fever given just how many savoury pasties contain tainted rat in place of more expensive meat.\n\n*Source: WFRP Core Rulebook*",
